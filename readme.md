# Etch-a-sketch

Welcome to my submission for the Etch-A-Sketch project for The Odin Project's web development curriculum!

## Description

This project is an interactive, browser-based version of the classic toy Etch-A-Sketch. Users can use their mouse to move a virtual "pen" around the screen and draw lines by pressing the left mouse button. Users can also clear the screen by pressing the 'clear' button.

To get started, simply open the project in your browser and start drawing!
